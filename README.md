## Installation

Please follow [installation instructions](https://docs.nextstrain.org/en/latest/install.html#installation-steps) for Nextstrain's software tools.

## Usage

To run pipeline for all available data for generated by ingest:

```
nextstrain build --docker .
```

To run the pipeline for specific data provenance and geo resolution (e.g. gisaid and global only):

```
nextstrain build --docker . --configfile config/config.yaml --config data_provenances=gisaid geo_resolutions=global
```

Edit the `prepare_data` params in `config/config.yaml` if you want to change any data preparation options.

## Configuration
The `data_provenances` and `geo_resolutions` are required configs for the pipeline.

The current available options for `data_provenances` are
- open
- gisaid

The current available options for `geo_resolutions` are
- global
- usa

### Environment variables

No environment variables are required for open data.
However, the following environment variables are required for the gisaid data:
- `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
